# The pool does not receive swapFee for swap transactions

## Summary
The `swapFee` must remain on the pool balance for distribution among tokens when users make transactions `D3MMNoBorrow.sellToken`, `D3MMNoBorrow.buyToken`, `D3Trading.sellToken`, `D3Trading.buyToken`. However, this does not happen. Thus only the maintainer receives fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `swapFee` is calculated in the `D3Trading.queryBuyTokens` and `D3Trading.querySellTokens` functions but is not taken into account when calculating the number of tokens that should be [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo/blob/ea7f786161113144562a900dbff31457ff7025ef/dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Trading.sol#L206) to the user or [received](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo/blob/ea7f786161113144562a900dbff31457ff7025ef/dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Trading.sol#L229-L239) as a result of the swap.

## Impact
Because of this issue, the `swapFee` do not remain on the pool balance and therefore the liquidity providers will not make a profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider taking `swapFee` into account when calculating the number of tokens sent to the user and when calculating swap transaction parameters:
querySellTokens:
```diff
-       return (payFromAmount, receiveToAmount - mtFee, vusdAmount, swapFee, mtFee);
+       return (payFromAmount, receiveToAmount - mtFee - swapFee, vusdAmount, swapFee, mtFee);
```
queryBuyTokens (the calculation may be different because of the `Users pay less fees using buyToken than using sellToken` issue):
```diff
-       toAmountWithFee = toAmount + mtFee;
+       toAmountWithFee = toAmount + mtFee + swapFee;
```
