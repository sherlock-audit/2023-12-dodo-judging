# Users pay less fees using buyToken than using sellToken

## Summary
Due to an error in the calculation of fees in the `D3Trading.queryBuyTokens` function, users will pay less fees for `buyToken` transactions than for `sellToken` transactions. This way the protocol and maintainer will receive less profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating fees in the `D3Trading.querySellTokens` function, the total number of tokens after the swap transaction `receiveToAmount` is used and the fee value is calculated from it. The final number of tokens to be sent to the user is determined by subtracting fee from `receiveToAmount`.

In the `D3Trading.queryBuyTokens` function, the final number of `toAmount` tokens is used to calculate fees, which is sent to the user, and then determined by `toAmountWithFee` by adding fees. Since `queryBuyTokens` fees are calculated from a smaller amount, the fee size will be smaller compared to `querySellTokens`.

I will give an example for clarity. Let fee = 10%. Let the user receive 90 tokens in both cases.
Calculation in the `querySellTokens` function:
After swap, the user should have 100 tokens.
fee = 100 * 10 / 100 = 10;
toUser = 100 - 10 = 90;
Calculation in the `queryBuyTokens` function:
The user requested 90 tokens.
fee = 90 * 10 / 100 = 9;
fromSwap = 90 + 9 = 99;
The correct calculation for this example is:
fromSwap = toUser * 100 / (100 - fee) = 90 * 100 / (100 - 10) = 100;
fee = fromSwap - toUser = 100 - 90 = 10;

## Impact
This issue leads to the loss of part of the profits from swap transactions by the protocol and the maintainer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the formula for calculating fees in the `D3Trading.queryBuyTokens` function to eliminate the inaccuracy. For example, in this form:
```diff
        // query amount and transfer out
        uint256 toAmountWithFee;
        {
        uint256 swapFeeRate = D3State.fromTokenMMInfo.swapFeeRate +  D3State.toTokenMMInfo.swapFeeRate;
-       swapFee = DecimalMath.mulFloor(toAmount, swapFeeRate);
        uint256 mtFeeRate = D3State.fromTokenMMInfo.mtFeeRate +  D3State.toTokenMMInfo.mtFeeRate;
-       mtFee = DecimalMath.mulFloor(toAmount, mtFeeRate);
-       toAmountWithFee = toAmount + mtFee;
+       toAmountWithFee = DecimalMath.divCeil(toAmount, (10**18 - mtFeeRate - swapFeeRate));
+       swapFee = DecimalMath.mulFloor(toAmountWithFee, swapFeeRate);
+       mtFee = toAmountWithFee - toAmount - swapFee;
        }
```
