# Risk of Overpayment Due to Inaccurate Debt Repayment Calculation in `_poolRepayAll` Function

## Summary
The `_poolRepayAll` function in the `D3VaultFunding` contract has an issue that may result in incomplete repayment of a borrower's debt. 
## Vulnerability Detail
 - A borrower (`D3Pool`) has a total outstanding debt of 100 tokens, and this debt is recorded in the `BorrowRecord` storage for a specific token.
 - The interest index at the time of borrowing is recorded as `record.interestIndex`.
 - The function `poolRepayAll` is called by the borrower to repay the entire outstanding debt for the specified token.
  Inside the `_poolRepayAll` function:
 - The function calculates the repayment amount (`amount`) using the `_borrowAmount` function.
 - The `amount` is derived from the borrower's total debt (`record.amount`) multiplied by the ratio of the current interest index (`info.borrowIndex`) to the interest index at the time of borrowing (`record.interestIndex`).
The function updates the borrower's BorrowRecord:
 - Sets the borrower's debt amount to 0.
 - Updates the interest index to the current interest index (`info.borrowIndex`).
 - Updates the total borrowed amount in the vault (`info.totalBorrows`) by subtracting the calculated repayment amount (`amount`).
 - Increases the vault's balance (`info.balance`) by the repayment amount.
 - Transfers the repayment amount from the borrower to the vault.
 - The `PoolRepay` event is emitted with the details of the repayment.

Issue:
The potential issue arises if, at the time of borrowing, the interest index (`record.interestIndex`) is different from the current interest index (`info.borrowIndex`). In such a case, the calculation of the repayment amount (`amount`) may not accurately reflect the entire outstanding debt, leading to an incomplete repayment.

Example:

Let's say the borrower initially borrowed 100 tokens when the interest index was 1.0.
The interest index has since increased to 1.2, and the borrower now wants to repay the entire debt using `poolRepayAll`.
The calculated amount would be `100 * (1.2 / 1.0) = 120`, but the actual outstanding debt is 100 tokens.

## Impact
The major impact of the concern in the `_poolRepayAll` function, where the repayment amount may not accurately reflect the entire outstanding debt, is the Risk of Unintended Overpayment. If the borrower is forced to repay more tokens than the actual outstanding debt, it can lead to overpayment, negatively impacting the borrower's liquidity and causing dissatisfaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the repayment amount (`amount`) is calculated using the current interest index (`info.borrowIndex`) for both the numerator and denominator in the `_borrowAmount` function.
