# D3Oracle will return the wrong price if the Chainlink aggregator returns price outside min/max range

## Summary
Chainlink oracles have a min and max price that they return. If the price goes below the minimum price the oracle will not return the correct price but only the min price. Same goes for the other extremity.

## Vulnerability Detail
D3Oracle uses the ChainlinkFeedRegistry to obtain the price of the requested tokens.

D3Oracle#getPriceFromFeed pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have `minPrice` and `maxPrice` circuit breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below the minPrice, the protocol will continue to value the token at minPrice instead of it's actual value. 

Example: TokenA has a minPrice of $1. The price of TokenA drops to $0.10. The aggregator still returns $1 which is 10x it's actual value.

## Impact
The wrong price may be returned in the event of a market crash.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use `min/max` values and check the result against these values
