# Precision Loss Risk in parseDec18Amount Function

## Summary
The `parseDec18Amount` function in the Solidity library Types introduces a potential risk of precision loss due to the order of operations when converting amounts between different decimal precisions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `parseDec18Amount` function is intended to convert an amount with 18 decimals (`amountWithDec18`) to the original precision specified by `tokenDec`. The vulnerability arises in the else branch, where the calculation of `realAmount` involves first dividing `amountWithDec18` by (`10 ** fixDec`) and then multiplying the result by (1`0 ** fixDec`). This sequence of operations can lead to precision loss, as the division is applied before the multiplication.
```solidity
function parseDec18Amount(uint256 amountWithDec18, uint256 tokenDec) internal pure returns(uint256 realAmount) {
    if(tokenDec < 18) {
        uint256 fixDec = 18 - tokenDec;
        realAmount = amountWithDec18 / (10 ** fixDec);
    } else if(tokenDec == 18) {
        realAmount = amountWithDec18;
    } else {
        uint256 fixDec = tokenDec - 18;
        realAmount = amountWithDec18 * (10 ** fixDec);
    }
}
```

## Impact
The potential precision loss in the `parseDec18Amount` function may result in inaccurate token amount conversions, affecting the reliability of calculations and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in decentralized finance applications.

## Recommendation
Reverse the order of operations in the `else` branch to ensure that multiplication is performed before division.
