# Lack of Effective Deadline Check in Token Swap Functions

## Summary
The contract lacks an effective deadline check in its token swap functions (`sellToken` and `buyToken`). The absence of a robust deadline mechanism can expose users to potential security risks, including front-running attacks, unexpected execution of pending transactions, and slippage due to outdated pricing information.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided code, the token swap functions `sellToken` and `buyToken` lack a comprehensive deadline check mechanism. The absence of a reliable deadline check introduces the following vulnerabilities:
- Front-Running Attacks:
A simple timestamp-based deadline check is susceptible to front-running attacks, where malicious actors exploit the time delay between transaction submission and confirmation. Attackers can manipulate transactions to their advantage, leading to unfavorable trade executions for legitimate users.
- Outdated Slippage:
The lack of a mechanism to dynamically update slippage calculations based on real-time market conditions leaves users vulnerable to outdated slippage estimates. This could result in unexpected slippage due to rapid changes in token prices.
- Unexpected Execution of Pending Transactions:
The absence of a robust deadline check may allow pending transactions to be unexpectedly executed, even if market conditions have changed. This exposes users to the risk of executing trades at prices significantly different from their expectations.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is multi-faceted. Users may experience front-running attacks, unexpected slippage, and unintended execution of trades, potentially leading to financial losses and a degraded user experience.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A more sophisticated deadline check mechanism that considers factors such as on-chain oracles for real-time pricing information, auction mechanisms, and a threshold for block confirmations.
