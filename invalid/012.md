# External function with an unbounded loop could lead to a DoS attack

## Summary
In `D3Maker::multicall` is used to send some parameters in one transaction, but it is a `external` function with an unbounded `for` loop. It could lead to a DoS attack if an attacker sends vast amounts of data to iterate over.

## Vulnerability Detail
`multicall` iterates over every item passed in the loop. 

## Impact
It can be deliberately attacked to make it more expensive or unusable for other users.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
The comment says:
```
    /// @notice maker could use multicall to set different params in one tx.
```
In this case it is smart to implement a limit on the length of the parameters array. Or use a `require` to check for only addresses that should interact with this function.
