# Missing Slippage Protection in some Functions

## Summary
A potential vulnerability to Sandwich Attacks exists in some function in the protocol. This type of attack manipulates market prices around a victim's transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
These functions allows users to sell their token in exchange for other tokens. The function parameter such as `minReceiveAmount`, is intended to provide slippage protection. 

However, as `minReceiveAmount` can be set to 0, attackers exploit it to ensure meeting the user's minimum expectation, securing profits and potentially resulting in a worse price for the victim.

## Impact
Users, especially when utilizing the `sellTokens` function, face potential asset losses due to vulnerabilities like front-running, sandwich, or transaction reordering attacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implementing validation for minimum amounts within the code can enhance user protection against such exploitative scenarios.
