# No Zero Address Check:

## Summary
No Zero Address Check: There is no check to prevent the new owner from being the zero address in the transferOwnership function, which could result in the contract having no owner if claimOwnership is called with _NEW_OWNER_ set to the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        emit OwnershipTransferPrepared(_OWNER_, newOwner);
        _NEW_OWNER_ = newOwner;
    }

## Impact
 contract having no owner if claimOwnership is called with _NEW_OWNER_ set to the zero address.
