# Looping Through Tokens

## Summary
Looping Through Tokens: The contract iterates through the poolTokenlist array to find the old token. If this list becomes very large, it could lead to high gas costs and potentially hit block gas limits, causing the transaction to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolTokenlist.length; i++) {
            if (poolTokenlist[i] == oldToken) {
                poolTokenlist[i] = token;
                break;
            }
        }
## Impact
 The contract iterates through the poolTokenlist array to find the old token. If this list becomes very large, it could lead to high gas costs and potentially hit block gas limits, causing the transaction to fail.
