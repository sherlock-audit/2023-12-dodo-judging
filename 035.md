# DOS in `tokenList` array

## Summary
new tokens are being pushed to an array which can cause DOS

## Vulnerability Detail
whenever the owner wants to add a new Token he calls the function `addNewToken` but the issue is that `ANY` token can be added and if the amount of tokens rise to a large amount of number then it can cause DOS

as you can see here that any erc20 token can be added, so when a large number of tokens are added then the functions like `accrueInterests`, `_getTotalDebtValue`, `getTotalAssetsValue`, `_getCollateralRatio` can be DOS and the important functionality of protocol and brick

## Impact
Whole protocol will stop working and the main functionality can brick
