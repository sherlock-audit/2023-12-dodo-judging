# access control:: init function

## Summary
The init function does not have any access control, which means that any user could potentially call it and reinitialize the contract's state variables. This could lead to a loss of control over the contract or other unexpected behavior. It should be protected by an onlyOwner modifier or similar access control mechanism, and it should only be callable once (e.g., by using a boolean state variable that ensures it can't be called more than once).
## Vulnerability Detail
function init(
        address creator,
        address maker,
        address vault,
        address oracle,
        address feeRateModel,
        address maintainer
    ) external {
        initOwner(creator);
        state._CREATOR_ = creator;
        state._D3_VAULT_ = vault;
        state._ORACLE_ = oracle;
        state._MAKER_ = maker;
        state._FEE_RATE_MODEL_ = feeRateModel;
        state._MAINTAINER_ = maintainer;
    }
