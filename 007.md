# Potential Token Transfer Vulnerability due to Insufficient Ownership Validation

## Summary
The contract exhibits a high-severity security concern in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions due to the reliance on the `_msgSender()` function without explicit ownership verification. This vulnerability introduces the risk of unauthorized token transfers, posing a severe threat to the integrity of token balances and compromising the overall security of the contract. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to replace the usage of `_msgSender()` with `msg.sender` directly in these functions, ensuring robust ownership checks during critical token transfer operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions is rooted in the usage of `_msgSender()` to determine the caller's address for authorization checks. These functions are fundamental to the ERC-20 standard and involve the transfer of tokens between addresses. Relying solely on `_msgSender()` without explicit ownership verification introduces a critical security risk.
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    address owner = _msgSender();
    require(amount <= balanceOf(owner), "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
    _transfer(owner, to, amount);
    return true;
}

function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    require(amount <= balanceOf(from), "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
    address spender = _msgSender();
    _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
    _transfer(from, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```
## Impact
Malicious actors could exploit the lack of explicit ownership checks in transfer operations, leading to unauthorized transfers of tokens. This not only jeopardizes the integrity of token balances but also poses a severe risk to the overall security of the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is crucial to replace the usage of `_msgSender()` with `msg.sender` directly in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. This modification ensures that the ownership check is explicitly based on the immediate sender of the transaction, reducing the risk of unauthorized token transfers.
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    address owner = msg.sender;
    require(amount <= balanceOf(owner), "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
    _transfer(owner, to, amount);
    return true;
}

function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    require(amount <= balanceOf(from), "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
    address spender = msg.sender;
    _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
    _transfer(from, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```
